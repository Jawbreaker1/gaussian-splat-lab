# RTX Workstation Setup

Verified: 2026-06-08

This document records the local workstation setup needed for the Gaussian Splat golden path.

## Current Environment

Host: Windows RTX 5090 workstation / WSL2
Python: 3.12.3
GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090, driver 610.47, 32607 MiB VRAM

Repo-local Python environment:

```text
.venv/
```

Validated in `.venv`:

- pip 26.1.2
- torch 2.11.0+cu128
- torchvision 0.26.0+cu128
- gsplat 1.5.3
- PyTorch CUDA smoke: pass on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090

Exact package freeze:

```text
requirements/gpu-cu128.txt
```

## COLMAP

COLMAP is installed on PATH:

```text
/usr/bin/colmap
colmap 3.9.1-2build2 from Ubuntu noble/universe
COLMAP 3.9.1 -- Structure-from-Motion and Multi-View Stereo
Commit Unknown on Unknown without CUDA
```

Validation:

```bash
colmap --help
.venv/bin/python scripts/lab-pipeline.py run-stage environment --job <job.json>
```

Revert if installed with apt:

```bash
sudo apt-get remove colmap
```

Notes:

- The installed Ubuntu package reports `without CUDA`. This is acceptable for the first golden-path SfM validation, but performance may be CPU-bound.
- If we later choose another COLMAP path, such as CUDA-enabled source build, local extracted binary, Docker, or Python bindings, record it in `framework-evaluation.json` and the installation ledger before installing.

## FFmpeg / ffprobe

FFmpeg and ffprobe are installed on PATH:

```text
/usr/bin/ffmpeg
/usr/bin/ffprobe
ffmpeg 7:6.1.1-3ubuntu5 from Ubuntu noble/universe
ffmpeg/ffprobe version 6.1.1-3ubuntu5
configuration includes --enable-gpl
```

Validation:

```bash
ffprobe -version
ffmpeg -version
```

Revert if installed with apt:

```bash
sudo apt-get remove ffmpeg
```

Notes:

- FFmpeg is conditional in the framework/commercial gate. Use it as a system external tool in this lab.
- The installed Ubuntu build includes `--enable-gpl`; do not bundle or redistribute this binary without LGPL/GPL/build-flag review.
- Record `ffmpeg -version` output and configure flags in stage reports before relying on it for product evaluation.
